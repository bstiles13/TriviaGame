A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or his/her time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, the browser displays a gif representing the correct choice. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed automatically.

If the player runs out of time, the player is notified that his/her time is up and a gif of the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.

On the final screen, the user is shown his/her number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game without reloading the page.
